A basic command line task manager

## Description

Thanks to github for suggesting the name, which seems quite appropriate. Eventually, this will be a command line interface built using Click and python that will let you manage day-to-day tasks (add, remove, list, rank, etc.).

At the moment, it is really rough as I'm building this from scratch. No template, nada. The intent is to dive in and build it from the ground up, as I tend to learn bbest that way.
